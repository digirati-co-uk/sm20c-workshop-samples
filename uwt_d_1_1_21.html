This has been found to be the case with many munition workers, who often prefer to work on night shift" so that they can do the house work during the day.<br>So long as these unequal standards of payment obtain between men and women, it follows that where women can be EMPLOYED IN THE PLACE OF MEN, whether their work is exactly the same or whether it is adjusted and re arranged, there will be a tendency to employ women, or fix the wages at the women' s rate.
