                <em>LSA</em>: <br> Curiously enough, these developments belong to the years following 1920, that is, to the period following the adoption by the House of Commons of the principle of Equal Pay for the Civil Service.<br>On this occasion the maximum of both sexes has been increased, but future women entrants will lose equality of pay with their male colleagues at the age of 19 instead of at 22 as at present.<br>In every parallel clerical grade of the Civil Service Equal Pay obtains up to the age of 22, and neither the Treasury nor the Department has advanced any valid reason for this departure from the general practice.<br>It was a condition of Sir Alfred Yarrow' s gift of an experimental tank to the National Physical Laboratory that the Scientific staff of that Department should receive Equal Pay.<br>Further information upon any of the matters mentioned in the Folders will gladly be furnished upon application to The Secretary , Civil Service Equal Pay Committee, Parliament Mansions, Victoria Street, Westminster, S.

Folder Two THE CIVIL SERVICE EQUAL PAY COMMITTEE The Flight from Equal Pay in the Civil Service This Folder, issued by the Civil Service Equal Pay Committee, is the second of a series, intended to explain and justify the demand of Civil Servants for the immediate application of Equal Pay for Equal Work to the Civil Service.<br>THE FLIGHT FROM EQUAL PAY IN THE CIVIL SERVICE It is sometimes assumed that the Civil Service is progressing towards Equal Pay though it has not yet attained it.<br>Every measure of reorganisation, whether general or sectional, has been used to deprive some staffs of Equal Pay or to standardise existing inequalities of pay in a direction unfavourable to women.<br>It is clearly Treasury policy not only to deny any closer approximation to Equal Pay, but actually to abolish Equal Pay in those small areas of the Civil Service where it exists.<br>It is suggested that Members may desire to file these Folders for reference, then when complete they will serve as a guide to the question of Equal Pay for Equal Work in the Civil Service.
