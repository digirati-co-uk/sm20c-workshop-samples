                <em>KL</em>: <br> It describes the different obstacles and prejudices against which professional women on the one hand and industrial women on the other have fought during the past century with very different results; owing, partly, no doubt, to the relative economic strength of the middle- class woman and the economic weakness of the industrial woman worker, and partly to the extraordinarily varied, confused and often crazy wage- structure into which the working woman was driven to enter.<br>In summary, 2 women in a few fields such as journalism and the stage are paid equally with men, whatever particular work they are doing; women in the majority of clerical and professional occupations earn from two- thirds to five- sixths as much as men; for women in Civil Defence and the Armed Forces the rate is two- thirds of the men' s; over the field of what is generally known as industry a woman, with certain exceptions, can expect to earn half, or a little more than half, of what a man in the same industry can expect to take home; while women engaged full- time in home keeping for their husbands and children get no wage at all, but have their services repaid in kind, with or without an unspecified quantity of pocket money.<br>It should be observed that this table refers to earnings, which include overtime and piecework, and not to time rates proper; Table II, which gives for February, 1939, the rates fixed by statute in the principal occupations covered by the Trade Boards Acts, shows no less of a gap between men' s rates and women' s. During the war, as during the war of 1914 18, the gap was narrowed to some extent, partly owing to the number of substituted ' women who were actually paid male rates.<br>jobs, who, like the bus- conductors, are receiving, as far as an outsider can judge, exactly the same rates as the men; there are others, doing what appears to be the same job in the same trade, but in a different factory, who are receiving much less; there are women who are working on piece- work on processes which, according to the Trade Unions, are identical with those performed by men, but who cannot possibly earn as much because the piece- work rate is fixed on the basis of a women' s time- rate', which is well below that of the man.<br>One school of thought says that the introduction of the Rate for the Job will drive women out of industry altogether, the other that it will draw a disproportionate number of women into factory work.
