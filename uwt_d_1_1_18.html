                <em>LSA</em>: <br> Yet it is precisely in bodies such as the London County Council, or alternatively the League of Nations and International Labour Office( both of which have adopted Equal Pay) that we find the closest analogy to the general Civil Service practice of recruiting men and women by the same test and with the same qualifications and of treating them as interchangeable for staffing purposes, a practice which it is necessary to bear in mind when comparing the Civil Service with other organisations.<br>Many women in responsible positions are to- day receiving less pay than the male staff under their immediate control, although this is plainly unfair to one sex and mischievous to both.<br>It makes this request on behalf of more than 300, 000 non- industrial staffs, including over 75, 000 women, of whom about 13, 700 are employed in " common" classes, and it would emphasise that Civil Servants of all ranks are gravely concerned at the present position.<br>So far as the first of these arguments is concerned, the present Financial Secretary to the Treasury has stated that the Government accepts the principle that we should be in the front rank, if not better than the best employers in the country.

Folder Six THE CIVIL SERVICE EQUAL PAY COMMITTEE Equal Pay for Equal Work This Folder, issued by the Civil Service Equal Pay Committee, is the sixth of a series intended to explain and justify the demand of Civil Servants for the im mediate application of the principle of Equal Pay for Equal Work to the Civil Service.<br>EQUAL PAY FOR EQUAL WORK During the past two months the Civil Service Equal Pay Committee has been privileged to furnish Members of Parliament with a series of Folders setting forth the case for the immediate application to the Civil Service of the principle of Equal Pay for Equal work.<br>Yet it is precisely in bodies such as the London County Council, or alternatively the League of Nations and International Labour Office( both of which have adopted Equal Pay) that we find the closest analogy to the general Civil Service practice of recruiting men and women by the same test and with the same qualifications and of treating them as interchangeable for staffing purposes, a practice which it is necessary to bear in mind when comparing the Civil Service with other organisations.<br>Nor can the Civil Service Equal Pay Committee accept the argument that the present differentiation in pay is justified by the sick leave rates or marriage wastage of women, or that it is justified by the fact that their services are of less value than those of men.<br>In view of the course of events within the Civil Service and the character of the most recent Government pronouncement in the House, the Civil Service Equal Pay Committee hopes that Members will press for a further Equal Pay debate during the lifetime of the present Parliament.
