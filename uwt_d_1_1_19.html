                <em>LSA</em>: <br> The House of Commons on two occasions affirmed the principle of Equal Pay in the Civil Service, first on May 19th, 1920, and again in August, 1921, but so far nothing has been done to put it into operation.<br>The reason given by the Government for the failure to implement the promise contained in the Resolutions referred to above is that the expense involved is too great, but it should be noted that the demand now put forward is not for the immediate payment of large sums of money, but for the setting up of a Select Com mittee to consider and report upon the best means of giving effect to the principle accepted by the House of Commons.<br>The demand for a Select Committee is based in part on the necessity for obtaining an authoritative statement as to the cost of applying the principle of Equal Pay.<br>Women are now employed on professional, adminis trative, executive, clerical, technical and other work in almost all Departments of State.<br>They hold important and equally responsible positions with men, but generally at a lower rate of pay.
